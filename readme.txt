@tik Remove Add to Cart button for Out of Stock items

Purpose
=======

There are several ways of dealing with Out of Stock products. Some of us don't want customers to be able to buy products that are out of stock.

OpenCart has an option (AP > System > Settings > {Edit store} > Option > Stock, mark Stock Checkout as No) that disallows customers to check out if they have an out of stock item in their shopping cart. This is a start, but for many of us it's just not consequential!

Hence this mod. This extension removes the Add to Cart button and replaces it with an "Out of stock" message for out-of-stock products. This way, customers can't even place an out-of-stock product into their shopping carts.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
